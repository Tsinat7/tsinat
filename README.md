I am a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering Program** and I want to revamp my GitHub profile to make it stand out from the crowd in my job search.


This is why I started with software engineering: I come from a background in mathematics and computer education, and I’ve seen firsthand how technology can transform the way we teach, learn, and connect. I am passionate about using tech to improve lives — particularly through creating engaging, accessible, and impactful digital experiences. What inspires me most is the potential of software to empower individuals, bridge educational gaps, and bring ideas to life in powerful ways.


My aim is to **bridge the gap between education and technology** by building tools that are not only functional, but deeply human-centered. I envision creating platforms that make learning more interactive, inclusive, and fun for users of all backgrounds. That’s why I would like to work on **projects that combine front-end development, user experience design, and educational technology** — such as interactive learning platforms, mobile-first web applications, and tools that support underserved communities.


### **Featured Projects**


- **EduPlay**: An interactive, game-based learning platform for primary school children.

- **MindMap**: A minimalist productivity app for goal setting and reflection.

- **Portfolio Website**: A responsive, animated portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
